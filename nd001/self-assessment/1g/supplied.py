# Introduction
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The purpose of this question is to ensure you
# have a baseline level of programming experience.
# This question asks you to write a small piece of
# code in Python. If you are unfamiliar with Python,
# the syntax is fairly straightforward. Check the
# Instructor Notes section below for some references.
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Problem Statement
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Write a function named addAllOdds which takes two
# integers as input and returns the sum of all the odd
# numbers between (but not including) those two numbers.
# For example:
#
# addOdds(5, 12) --> returns 27 (7 + 9 + 11)
# addOdds(3, -5) --> returns -3 (1 + -1 + -3)
# addOdds(18,18) --> returns 0
#
# You may use the "Test Run" button to test your code.
# When your function behaves as expected, press Submit
# to have your work evaluated by the auto-grader.

def addOdds(int1, int2):
	# your code here



# assert statements raise an error if they are false
assert addOdds(5, 12) == 27
assert addOdds(3, -5) == -3
assert addOdds(18,18) == 0
